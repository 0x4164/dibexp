,{"ID":1988,"title":"Chuck Close","content":"<p>The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who\\u2019ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work.<\/p>\\n<p>If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.<\/p>\\n<p>Things occur to you. If you\\u2019re sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction.<\/p>\\n<p>Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that\\u2019s almost never the case.<\/p>\\n","link":"https:\/\/quotesondesign.com\/chuck-close\/"}
